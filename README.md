# High-Level Design

## Frontend

- Use React or Angular for creating a responsive, user-friendly interface
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality using libraries like React-DND or Angular CDK
- Connect to the backend API using Axios or Fetch for API requests

## Backend

- Use Spring Boot with Java or Kotlin as the backend framework
- Implement the previously mentioned API design
- Use Spring Data JPA for PostgreSQL interaction and the Elasticsearch REST client for Elasticsearch interaction

## Infrastructure

- Containerize the application using Docker
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and deployment
- Utilize cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for deploying and managing the infrastructure

# Detailed Design

- Implement a modular folder structure for the backend codebase, separating microservices, models, routes, and controllers
- Use middleware for common functionalities like authentication, error handling, and request/response validation
- Follow the SOLID design principles to create reusable and maintainable code
- Use Spring Boot's built-in features for common functionalities like authentication, error handling, and request/response validation

## Frontend

1. Components:
   - Create reusable components for the editor, operator palette, pipeline canvas, and monitoring/alerting dashboards
   - Use state management libraries, like Redux or MobX, to manage the application state

2. Services:
   - Implement services for interacting with the backend API and handling data processing, such as pipeline configuration and operator management

3. Styling:
   - Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and responsive design
   - Use CSS-in-JS libraries, like styled-components or Emotion, for component-specific styling

## Backend

1. Microservices:
   - Implement each microservice as a separate package, responsible for handling its specific set of features
   - Use the repository pattern to separate the data access layer from the business logic

2. Middleware:
   - Utilize Spring Boot's built-in features, like security and exception handling, to secure access to API endpoints and handle errors
   - Create custom validation and request/response transformation using filters and aspects, if necessary

3. Event-driven architecture:
   - Use a message broker (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) to allow microservices to communicate asynchronously, improving scalability and decoupling

4. Caching:
   - Implement caching strategies using Spring Boot's caching abstraction with Redis or Hazelcast as cache providers

5. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Utilize Spring Boot's built-in logging with Logback or Log4j2 for structured logging
   - Integrate with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation, analysis, and visualization
   - Implement Micrometer and Grafana for monitoring and alerting purposes

## Testing

1. Unit testing:
   - Use Jest or Mocha for unit testing in both frontend and backend
   - Implement test cases covering individual functions, components, and API endpoints

2. Integration testing:
   - Test the interactions between microservices, databases, and external systems
   - Utilize tools like Postman or Newman for API integration testing

3. End-to-end testing:
   - Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to test the application's functionality from the user's perspective

4. Performance testing:
   - Utilize tools like JMeter or Locust to simulate load and evaluate the application's performance under stress
